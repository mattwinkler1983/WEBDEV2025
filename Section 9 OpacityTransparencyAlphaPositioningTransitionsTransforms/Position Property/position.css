div {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;

#static #middle { 
position: static; 


}
#relative #middle {
    position: relative;
    top: 100px;
    left: 100px;

#absolute {
position: relative;

/* positions are STATIC by default.  So if you set the position to Static nothing changes.  
   Setting it to position "relative" alone does not do anything.  But if you put in top, bottom, left, or right it will change it.  So for example with this: 
   
   #relative #middle {
    position: relative;
    top: 100px;
}

This will set it to go down by 100 px ( pixels ).  If you set it left to 100px this will actually move it to the right.  You can also do negative values. 


Another option is ASOLUTE.
