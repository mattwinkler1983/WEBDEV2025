An ID selector in CSS is used to select a unique element in an HTML document based on its unique id attribute. 
Here's how it works:
Unique Identifier: In your HTML, you assign a unique id attribute to the element you want to style.
For example: <h1 id="main-title">Welcome to the Site</h1>.
CSS Syntax: In your CSS stylesheet, you target that element using a hash symbol (#) followed by the id name.
Example:
css
#main-title {
    color: darkblue;
    font-size: 32px;
}
