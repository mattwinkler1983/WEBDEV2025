Set the variable called greeting  to some greeting, e.g. "hello".

Set the variable called name  to some name, e.g. "Heisenberg".

Then set the variable called greet_name  so that it concatenates greeting , name , and a space " " between them.


SOLUTION:

greeting = "hello"
name = "Heisenberg"
greet_name = greeting + " " + name

greeting = "hello"
name = "Dave"
greet_name = greeting + " " + name
